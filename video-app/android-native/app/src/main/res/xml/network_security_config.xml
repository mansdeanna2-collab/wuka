    Network Security Configuration for Video Player App
    
    This configuration allows:
    1. Cleartext (HTTP) traffic for video streaming from various sources
    2. HTTPS connections with system trust anchors
    
    Note: This is required for video apps that need to stream from various
    sources that may not have HTTPS configured.
