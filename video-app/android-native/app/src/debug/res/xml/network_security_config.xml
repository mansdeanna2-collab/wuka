    Network Security Configuration for Video Player App (DEBUG)
    
    This debug configuration allows:
    1. Cleartext (HTTP) traffic for video streaming
    2. HTTPS connections with both system and user-installed certificates
    
    The user certificates are included to allow debugging with tools like
    Charles Proxy or other HTTPS inspection proxies.
    
    NOTE: This file is only used in debug builds. Release builds use the
    main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml which only trusts system certificates.
